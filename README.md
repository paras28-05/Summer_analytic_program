Project Description
The goal of this project is to predict the likelihood of individuals receiving two different types of vaccines: the xyz flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine. This is formulated as a multilabel classification problem, where each individual can receive either, both, or neither of the vaccines. The dataset contains various features about the respondents, such as demographic information, behavioral patterns, and opinions about the vaccines.

Data
The dataset consists of:

training_set_features.csv: Features for training data.
training_set_labels.csv: Labels for training data.
test_set_features.csv: Features for test data.
submission_format.csv: Template for the submission file.
The features include demographic information, behavioral patterns, and opinions on vaccine effectiveness and safety. The labels are binary indicators of whether the respondent received the xyz flu vaccine and the seasonal flu vaccine.
